# Blockchain_Execution_Layer_Simulation
This project simulates the working of a custom blockchain execution layer. It contains key generation for the local nodes, signatures using elliptic curve digital signature algorithm, memory pool functionality, a Fast Api implementation and the blockchain data structure. 

### Parts Simulated in this Project:

1. Blockchain Data Structure
2. Memory Pool
3. Transaction Building Transactions Validation
4. Transaction signature and verification
5. Block Validation
6. Blockchain Validation and Leader Block Validation
7. Raft Consensus Mechanism
8. API Buioding using FastAPI
